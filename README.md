# ðŸ¤” Too lazy to build yourself?
**I can probably help you out!**

I'll probably open my services every now and then, but do check this [Mastodon post](https://rubber.social/@Xantw0) for more info on price, availability and contact info

# âœ¨ Thanks
This project was inpired by [gdog](https://woof.group/@gdog) and Icteryn from this [Mastodon post](https://woof.group/@gdog/111154452751612377). I was playing around in Fusion360 and that got me to learn FreeCAD, so the logical thing was to share this dumb project with you too.

Also thanks to [Hex](https://linktr.ee/puphex) for his help showing me picture and refrence of some of his hoods to make sure my mesurements were correct!
